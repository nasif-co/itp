                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 03</h2>
                <p>For the third week we had to work with the laser cutter, making the same piece in two different scales, and using some sort of joinery.</p>
                <p>I really struggled with this assignment since I very much dislike the way laser cut wood smells and looks, and sanding does not really help if you need the precision of the laser cuts, which is its main appeal. After wasting a lot of time thinking around this, I settled with making a more decorative than useful piece: fridge magnets.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/anni-albers.webp" alt="Geometrical design of a rug, by Anni Albers.">
                        <figcaption>I was inspired by the work of Anni Albers, which is why I thought about making a geometrical design joining laser cut wood and acrylic.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/pattern-ideas.webp" alt="Vector geometrical patterns in blue.">
                        <figcaption>I tested some vector patterns in illustrator and ultimately opted for the square grid on the bottom, especially because I was unsure about how strong the wood was going to be with very thin lines.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I began by preparing the wood and buying the right acrylic:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/slice-plank.webp" alt="Large block of wood on the band saw with a slice taken off.">
                        <figcaption>I sliced off a long plank of wood off of my large wood block, trying to approximate a 1/8in depth, same as the acrylic I had bought.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/plank-snad.webp" alt="A long plank of pine wood.">
                        <figcaption>I squared out the plank as best I could and sanded with 100 grit to get a clean uniform surface.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Once the materials were ready, I began testing the laser cutting and the curf.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/laser-cut-test.webp" alt="Wood plank with a square hole cut out. A hand hold the cut out piece.">
                        <figcaption>I began by making a square hole the same size of my design. I also measured the actual size of the hole and laser cut an equivalent piece in acrylic.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/measure-laser-cut-difference.webp" alt="Digital calliper measuring a small blue square reads 4.01mm. A computer screen in the background reads 4.267mm.">
                        <figcaption>The acrylic piece I cut was too small, which allowed me to calculate how much was lost on the cutting operation. I then re cut the square.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/test-insert.webp" alt="Small blue acrylic square inserted into wooden plank">
                        <figcaption>The newly cut square fit, although a bit too snuggly. In hindsight I should've kept testing at this stage but I was satisfied with this result.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>With my tests done (or so I thought) I began making the actual cuts</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/shallow-cut.webp" alt="Square grid etched with laser onto a wooden plank.">
                        <figcaption>My first cut did not fully go through. Because my test cut before with the same settings in the same machine had gone through easily, I trusted this was the case again and removed the material.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/full-cut-and-sand.webp" alt="Square grids cut out of a wooden plank.">
                        <figcaption>I redid the cuts in a new area, running the machine two times. It still did not cut through some squares. You can see that the incomplete cuts are always in the darker area of the wood, which makes me think this part is stronger. I sanded it down and scraped out the squares that were not cut through.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I cut the pieces down to size using the miter saw, leaving a small gap to sand down.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/sand-to-size.webp" alt="Two wooden pieces with square grids and a longer wooden plank.">
                        <figcaption>I then sanded down the sides and sanded the top surface to 400 grit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I cut out the squares and used some tape to recover the pieces so they would not fall down the grates.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I also laser cut the larger squares for the larger version of the piece (which was like a zoom-in on the pattern). I used the same calculation of the curf for these pieces. With that ready, I started the assembly.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>Upon adding the inserts, I realized they were exerting too much pressure on the wood and even caused some cracks. In hindsight, I shouldn't have sanded down the piece to size until it was fully assembled.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I tested new sizes for both the small and large squares and then recut them. I also used some glue to fix the cracks.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I assembled the small piece with the newly cut squares. Some fit easily, others required more force. Some small cracks are also visible on the perimeter but none as severe as with the larger piece.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>With this, my decorative pieces were done. I would then wait for the glue to set and stick a magnetic film to the back.</p>

            <div class="blog-week">
                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 02</h2>
                <p>This week we were assigned with making 5 identical pieces. An exercise in repeatability and techniques like the use of jigs or stop-blocks. Since I've been thinking of buying some hangers for the apartment, I decided to make my own.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I began making some sketches. Since my theme are boolean operations, I want to make my pieces using mainly joinery, which can also be decorative.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I began by working on the main block of the hangers. First I sanded the block up to 400 grit on all side except the ends.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I used the bad saw to split the wood in half lengthwise.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I then measured the length of each block and used the measurement to adjust a stop-block on the compund miter saw. With it I cut all my blocks to size.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/sized-blocks.webp" alt="Six small blocks of wood of identical sizes.">
                        <figcaption>Once cut, I sanded the new edges up to 400 grit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I then worked on the hole which would join the dowels to the main piece.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/diagonal-drill-jig.webp" alt="Jig on a vice under a bench press.">
                        <figcaption>I set up a jig with a scrap piece of wood that had a diagonal cut on it. I used tape to hold a base block so the blocks to drill would have the same starting point when lying on the inclined plane.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>These were the results.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Afterwards, I worked on the dowel pieces of the hangers.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I measured the size of the hangers that I wanted (taking into account the parts to be lost in the joinery) and cut them in the miter saw with help of a stop-block.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I used the bench drill to very carefully make holes into the dowel from the top, as to fit the smaller dowels inside. I couldn't really figure out a good way to make a jig for these. In retrospect, I should have set the bit on the vise below and the dowels held by the press teeth.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/dowel-step-down.webp" alt="6 dowels, each with a smaller dowel placed inside from the top.">
                        <figcaption>Once they all fit nicely, I glued them down.</figcaption>

                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/countersunk-spheres.webp" alt="6 dowels, each going through a wood sphere.">
                        <figcaption>I also made countersunk holes in the cedar wood spheres. Once again, I now realize I should have held these in the press teeth and had the bit be on the bottom held by the vise.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/sand-hangers.webp" alt="A dowel going through a sphere, rotating in a bench press.">
                        <figcaption>Once dry, I put them in the bench press to sand them as if it were a lathe. Since they weren't perfectly center, it didn't work perfectly.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>With all the pieces ready for assembly, I prepared the straps from the design. My friend Bethany very kindly gave me different colors of leather that she had and explained to me how to work with them.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I cut the straps with a box cutter, and then made the holes, using the first hole I made as a guide for the rest of them.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Then I put the dowels through the straps.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/hammer-in.webp" alt="A block of wood with a diagonal dowel coming out of it, clamped down on a vise.">
                        <figcaption>I added some glue in the holes, clamped the base block down and used a mallet to hammer in the dowels. Sadly, the hole I had made was a little bit too small, so I could not push the dowels all the way to the other side, no matter how much force I used.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Lastly, I finished the hangers.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>I used a saw to cut the excess dowel from the spheres.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I also sanded down the spheres after the cut, up to 400 grit, and then added some tung oil as a finish.</p>

                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 01</h2>
                <p>For the first week we had to make a simple box out of one piece of wood. Since this was the only assignment that didn't necessarily need to fit the chosen theme, I decided to take it as a low-stakes way to get into the groove of making while I decided what my theme for the other assignments would be.</p>

                <p>Once the block was the right size, I proceeded with the hole for the screw. I really didn't want the screw to be visible so I planned to cover it up with a wood plug.</p>

                        <figcaption>I wasn't sure which drill bit size to use for my wood plug, so I tested different sizes on a scrap piece of wood until the dowel I had fit snuggly.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>After making the larger hole for the wood plug on my box, I cut the lid apart from the body. This operation was at first difficult, I felt I had to do too much force for it to cut. Ian instructed me to use another piece of wood to help the box keep steady as I cut, making sure no perpendicular force was being exerted on the blade.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I cut some small wooden planks off some scrap wood using the band saw to test out the idea of covering the bottom of the box up. I then tried to make the same cuts with the wood I made the box out of. However, I once again was having to exert too much force in the band saw. Since Ian had already left, I decided to err on the side of caution and use the planks I had already made.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I added wood glue and pasted the two planks on top of the rough bottom surface. I also placed a piece of acrylic before clamping, since I was afraid that the overflowing glue would stick to any piece of wood I added as an aid when clamping.</figcaption>
