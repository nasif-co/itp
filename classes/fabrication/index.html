                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 01</h2>
                <p>For the first week we had to make a simple box out of one piece of wood. Since this was the only assignment that didn't necessarily need to fit the chosen theme, I decided to take it as a low-stakes way to get into the groove of making while I decided what my theme for the other assignments would be.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/source-material.webp" alt="A long block of wood. A tag stuck on it reads 'Vertical/Tube' and contact details.">
                        <figcaption>I found this long block of wood and claimed it, as it seemed that it would be really good for the wood lathe in the future.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                        <figcaption>I cut a piece off the block on the compound miter saw so it would be easier to work with..</figcaption>

                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/measurements.webp" alt="A block of wood with lines and markings made with a pencil.">
                        <figcaption>Once I had this piece, I decided I really wanted my box to be more like a cube. I made some measurements and marking for the cuts and the screwhole.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/final-cut.webp" alt="A block of wood being cut in the band saw.">
                        <figcaption>I cut the block once more to my desired size.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Once the block was the right size, I proceeded with the hole for the screw. I really didn't want the screw to be visible so I planned to cover it up with a wood plug.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I made the deep hole for the screw to go into.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/avellanado-tests.webp" alt="A small wood plant with 2 empty holes and a wooden dowel sticking out of a third hole.">
                        <figcaption>I wasn't sure which drill bit size to use for my wood plug, so I tested different sizes on a scrap piece of wood until the dowel I had fit snuggly.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/lid-cut.webp" alt="A cube-like piece of wood being cut on the band saw. Another adjacent piece of wood holds the piece being cut steady.">
                        <figcaption>After making the larger hole for the wood plug on my box, I cut the lid apart from the body. This operation was at first difficult, I felt I had to do too much force for it to cut. Ian instructed me to use another piece of wood to help the box keep steady as I cut, making sure no perpendicular force was being exerted on the blade.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Afterwards I continued with making the cavity for my box.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/cavity-sketch.webp" alt="Wooden cube with an inset square-shaped pencil marking.">
                        <figcaption>I measured and marked the size of the cavity to be removed from the box.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>Approximated the marked cavity with a forstner bit, using the bench press carefully to keep a consistent depth.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>As I was trying to even out the cavity with a chisel, my friend Niko (who has ample experience building wooden sail boats) gave me a thorough explanation of how to use the chisel.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>With his tips, I managed to even out the shape of the cavity to my liking.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I then added the screw to give the box its intended functionality.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I chose a countersunk screw so it would sit as flush as possible with the bottom of the wood-plug hole.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/plug-cut.webp" alt="Wooden dowel being cut on the band saw.">
                        <figcaption>I cut the wooden dowel down to a more manageable size.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>After adding some wood glue, I stuck the dowel into the screw hole and let it dry overnight.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/plug-sawn-off.webp" alt="Wooden dowel insed a wood plank, cut flush with the plank.">
                        <figcaption>Once it was dry, I used a hand saw to cut it flush with the surface.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>At this moment, I was a little bit bothered by the roughness of box's bottom surface, inside the cavity.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/bottom-cover.webp" alt="Small wooden planks and a box cutter on top of a table.">
                        <figcaption>I cut some small wooden planks off some scrap wood using the band saw to test out the idea of covering the bottom of the box up. I then tried to make the same cuts with the wood I made the box out of. However, I once again was having to exert too much force in the band saw. Since Ian had already left, I decided to err on the side of caution and use the planks I had already made.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>I added wood glue and pasted the two planks on top of the rough bottom surface. I also placed a piece of acrylic before clamping, since I was afraid that the overflowing glue would stick to any piece of wood I added as an aid when clamping.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>With the help of a bigger piece of wood on top of the acrylic plank, I clamped it down and let it dry overnight.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, I finished my box by sanding.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I also added some tung oil with a cloth and let it dry overnight.</p>
