                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 05 & 06</h2>
                <p>These last two weeks of the course were focused on the final assignment: fabricating and object that uses two materials and fasteners. For this one, I wanted to experiment with bent metal tubes to create legs for a wooden table.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/table-sketch-2.webp" alt="Sketch of a table with twisting legs.">
                        <figcaption>This was the initial design for the table. After talking to Phil and analyzing the possibilities, it was evident that these bends would be very complicated to make.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/table-sketch-1.webp" alt="Sketch of a stool with metal tube legs.">
                        <figcaption>This was a different idea, making it a stool instead of a table. In order to get the legs in with that angle, I would have had to make some angled holes and split the top in half, which was going to be a very precise operation.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>After these sketches and discussing the idea with Phil and Niko, I decided to do a blend of the ideas, to simplify the fabrication process a bit.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/conduit-tubes.webp" alt="1/2 inch metal conduit tubes.">
                        <figcaption>These were the tubes to be used for the legs. They are usually used in high quantities for electrical work, so buying just a few was not too expensive.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/hand-bending-tube.webp" alt="Man bending conduit tubes.">
                        <figcaption>A picture of me bending the tubes. Here you can see me doing it wrong, because I thought placing my foot on the tool was not necessary. However, it is imperative to get a correct bend. Otherwise the tube can move and mess up the bend.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/failed-bend.webp" alt="Badly-bent metal tubes.">
                        <figcaption>This was the result of those wrong bends. Also, after show it to Phil, he also believed I was too ambitious trying to get a fully rounded 90 degree bend, which might not be possible with this tool.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/bent-legs.webp" alt="Bent metal tubes.">
                        <figcaption>I rewatched the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3h97SfQYYI">maker pipe bending tutorial</a> very carefully and placed the correct markers on the tube. Then I bent them and got this result.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/leveling-legs.webp" alt="Cut-off end of metal tubes">
                        <figcaption>I used a metal hack saw to cut the extra tube on one side to level out the legs.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/sanded-legswebp.webp" alt="Two bent metal tubes on a piece of white paper">
                        <figcaption>I then roughly wet-sanded the legs with 320 grit, in preparation for painting.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/pre-paint-legs.webp" alt="Two bent metal tubes hanging from the paint booth.">
                        <figcaption>I hung the legs from the booth in order to paint them completely without having to do one side and then the other side.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/dry-table-legs.webp" alt="Orange metal legs handing upside down.">
                        <figcaption>I then hung them on the side of the drying shelves.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/painted-legs.webp" alt="Orange metal legs on a table.">
                        <figcaption>Two days later I picked them up and the paint had a very nice texture. Although, because I didn't have enough time to use the primer or the clear coat, the finish is somewhat fragile.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>In parallel, I was also working on the tabletop, made out of a solid wood plank.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/hole-markers.webp" alt="Long wood plank with markings for holes.">
                        <figcaption>I bought a wooden plank and decided to make the table the exact size of the plank. I started by roughly sanding the plank and then making the markings for the 4 holes.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/prep-hole-jig.webp" alt="Pieces of wood clamped to the bed of a drill press, fashioning a jig.">
                        <figcaption>I made a jig to keep the holes 20mm away from the edges of the wood plank.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/hole-jigs.webp" alt="Hole on a wood plank.">
                        <figcaption>The holes made by the jig fit exactly in the markings I made. Very satisfying.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/test-fit.webp" alt="Metal table legs going through a wooden plank.">
                        <figcaption>At this stage, I tested the fit of the legs in the table.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/measure-bend.webp" alt="Ruler on top of a bent metal table leg.">
                        <figcaption>I measured the length of the bend on the table leg, to figure out the size of the slots required so that the legs could go through and sit on top of the tabletop.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/guiding-holes.webp" alt="Markings on a plank of wood, going from one hole to another.">
                        <figcaption>I measured and marked the different parts of the slots to be machined, and then cut holes on the ends of each slot.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>At this point I had to use the router in order to make the channel and the slots through which the legs would pass. Although I had gone through the demo, I was a bit unsure of using the router, so I asked my friend Niko for some guidance.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/router-clamps.webp" alt="Wood clamped around a larger plank of wood making a slim channel.">
                        <figcaption>We clamped long pieces of wood on both sides to create a channel that would guide the router bit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/leg-channel.webp" alt="A plank of wood with a channel running across it.">
                        <figcaption>This is the resulting channel created using that setup. I then clamped the piece of wood on its own hanging over the side of the table, and used the router directly over it for the slots that had to go through.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/sanded-tabletop.webp" alt="Plank of wood with two holes on each side and a channel running through them.">
                        <figcaption>Once this was all done, I used the roundover bit all around the tabletop. I also sanded the wood up to 600 grit and then added a few light coats of tung oil, buffing it out with a rag to make it shine a bit more.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, I figured out how to fasten the legs to the tabletop.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/self-drilling.webp" alt="Box of self drilling screws.">
                        <figcaption>I bought these self drilling wood-to-metal screws in the smallest length they offered. However, according to my calculations, they were a bit longer than what I needed. So I tried to make some wooden spacers for them, but they didn't work very well and the screws didn't grip the metal.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/cut-fastener.webp" alt="Self drilling screw with the tap cut off.">
                        <figcaption>In the end, I decided to use the screw to make the hole in the metal legs, and then take it out, cut the drilling part off, and then screw it into the metal legs. This way, the screw was no longer too long.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/table-fastener.webp" alt="Wooden table with screw going through it and its metal legs.">
                        <figcaption>This is what that looked like. It was very difficult to get the legs to be perfectly aligned.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>With that I was done:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/final-table.webp" alt="Wooden table with orange metal legs.">
                        <figcaption>The final piece. Because of the difficulty aligning the legs, one of them was a bit longer which made the table wobble a little bit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-week">
                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 04</h2>
                <p>This fourth week was dedicated to enclosures, using the techniques we have learnt plus possibly the router. I decided I wanted to make a flashlight, which was ambicious in hindsight, given the limited time.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/lamp-sketch.webp" alt="Sketch of a flashlight.">
                        <figcaption>The design I made for it was a simple dowel as a handle and a larger cone-shaped piece for the light to project out of. From the base of the handle pops out a small dowel with a sphere, which can be pulled/pushed to dim the flashlight.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/lamp-measurements.webp" alt="Section view sketch of a flashlight.">
                        <figcaption>I made some measurements (which would later change) based on the way I would structure the inside. The idea was to have the interior lined with plastic tubing. The piston would pass through a plug that fits tightly into the tube. It then keeps going and grabs hold of the bottom of an upside down slider. The wiper on the slider is held in place as it is mounted on the tubing lining.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>After planning out the logistics with the help of Phil, I went on with getting the parts to be enclosed.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/flashlight-breakdown.webp" alt="Flashlight pieces on a cutting mat.">
                        <figcaption>I bought a cheap flashlight and tore it apart into its constituents.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/flashlight-circuit.webp" alt="Front view of a small circuit board.">
                        <figcaption>I analyzed the circuit to understand how it worked, since the flashlight had 5 different modes. It basically consisted of the LED and an IC that controlled those modes. As I couldn't find a datasheet for the IC, I assumed it was a custom solution for this product. So I then decided to desolder the ic and the button, and leave only the LED and battery terminals.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <video controls loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/dim-flashlight.webm" alt="A breadboard with a potentiometer dimming an LED."></video>
                        <figcaption>I built a simple circuit using a mosfet to control the dimming of the flashlight. The beauty of it is that the mosftet takes negligible current to control, so when the resistance of the potentiometer is very high, basically no current is being used, saving battery power.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/flashlight-mod.webp" alt="Makeshift circuit with a transistor.">
                        <figcaption>I then soldered the circuit trying to keep the smallest footprint possible.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/circuit-terminals.webp" alt="Small electronic terminals.">
                        <figcaption>I decided to use these terminals for the connection to the potentiometer, since I wanted it to be easy to disconnect if the need arises, so that this piece can fully come out of the flashlight.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>

                </div>
                <p>I then moved onto one of the big challenges of this build: hollowing out the handle.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>This is the first test I did cutting into the cyling with a spade bit (since it was the longest one). After this one, I managed to cut into one of this small test cylindes.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Another failed test, still using the spade bit with a bit extender. At this point I realized that the bit extender was really imprecise and very tricky to get it to go deep in a perfectly straight line.</figcaption>

                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 03</h2>
                <p>For the third week we had to work with the laser cutter, making the same piece in two different scales, and using some sort of joinery.</p>
                <p>I really struggled with this assignment since I very much dislike the way laser cut wood smells and looks, and sanding does not really help if you need the precision of the laser cuts, which is its main appeal. After wasting a lot of time thinking around this, I settled with making a more decorative than useful piece: fridge magnets.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>I was inspired by the work of Anni Albers, which is why I thought about making a geometrical design joining laser cut wood and acrylic.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I tested some vector patterns in illustrator and ultimately opted for the square grid on the bottom, especially because I was unsure about how strong the wood was going to be with very thin lines.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I began by preparing the wood and buying the right acrylic:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/slice-plank.webp" alt="Large block of wood on the band saw with a slice taken off.">
                        <figcaption>I sliced off a long plank of wood off of my large wood block, trying to approximate a 1/8in depth, same as the acrylic I had bought.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I squared out the plank as best I could and sanded with 100 grit to get a clean uniform surface.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Once the materials were ready, I began testing the laser cutting and the curf.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>I began by making a square hole the same size of my design. I also measured the actual size of the hole and laser cut an equivalent piece in acrylic.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                        <figcaption>The acrylic piece I cut was too small, which allowed me to calculate how much was lost on the cutting operation. I then re cut the square.</figcaption>

                <p>With my tests done (or so I thought) I began making the actual cuts</p>

                        <figcaption>My first cut did not fully go through. Because my test cut before with the same settings in the same machine had gone through easily, I trusted this was the case again and removed the material.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I redid the cuts in a new area, running the machine two times. It still did not cut through some squares. You can see that the incomplete cuts are always in the darker area of the wood, which makes me think this part is stronger.

                </div>
                <p>I also laser cut the larger squares for the larger version of the piece (which was like a zoom-in on the pattern). I used the same calculation of the curf for these pieces. With that ready, I started the assembly.</p>

                        <figcaption>I assembled the small piece with the newly cut squares. Some fit easily, others required more force. Some small cracks are also visible on the perimeter but none as severe as with the larger piece.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>With this, my decorative pieces were done. I would then wait for the glue to set and stick a magnetic film to the back.</p>

                <p>This week we were assigned with making 5 identical pieces. An exercise in repeatability and techniques like the use of jigs or stop-blocks. Since I've been thinking of buying some hangers for the apartment, I decided to make my own.</p>

                        <figcaption>I then measured the length of each block and used the measurement to adjust a stop-block on the compund miter saw. With it I cut all my blocks to size.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I also made countersunk holes in the cedar wood spheres. Once again, I now realize I should have held these in the press teeth and had the bit be on the bottom held by the vise.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Once dry, I put them in the bench press to sand them as if it were a lathe. Since they weren't perfectly center, it didn't work perfectly.</figcaption>

                <p>With all the pieces ready for assembly, I prepared the straps from the design. My friend Bethany very kindly gave me different colors of leather that she had and explained to me how to work with them.</p>

                        <figcaption>I added some glue in the holes, clamped the base block down and used a mallet to hammer in the dowels.

                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 01</h2>
                <p>For the first week we had to make a simple box out of one piece of wood. Since this was the only assignment that didn't necessarily need to fit the chosen theme, I decided to take it as a low-stakes way to get into the groove of making while I decided what my theme for the other assignments would be.</p>

                        <figcaption>I found this long block of wood and claimed it, as it seemed that it would be really good for the wood lathe in the future.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Once I had this piece, I decided I really wanted my box to be more like a cube. I made some measurements and marking for the cuts and the screwhole.</figcaption>

                </div>
                <p>Once the block was the right size, I proceeded with the hole for the screw. I really didn't want the screw to be visible so I planned to cover it up with a wood plug.</p>

                        <figcaption>I wasn't sure which drill bit size to use for my wood plug, so I tested different sizes on a scrap piece of wood until the dowel I had fit snuggly.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>After making the larger hole for the wood plug on my box, I cut the lid apart from the body. This operation was at first difficult, I felt I had to do too much force for it to cut. Ian instructed me to use another piece of wood to help the box keep steady as I cut, making sure no perpendicular force was being exerted on the blade.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Afterwards I continued with making the cavity for my box.</p>

                        <figcaption>As I was trying to even out the cavity with a chisel, my friend Niko (who has ample experience building wooden sail boats) gave me a thorough explanation of how to use the chisel.</figcaption>

                <p>I then added the screw to give the box its intended functionality.</p>

                <p>At this moment, I was a little bit bothered by the roughness of box's bottom surface, inside the cavity.</p>

                        <figcaption>I cut some small wooden planks off some scrap wood using the band saw to test out the idea of covering the bottom of the box up. I then tried to make the same cuts with the wood I made the box out of. However, I once again was having to exert too much force in the band saw. Since Ian had already left, I decided to err on the side of caution and use the planks I had already made.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I added wood glue and pasted the two planks on top of the rough bottom surface. I also placed a piece of acrylic before clamping, since I was afraid that the overflowing glue would stick to any piece of wood I added as an aid when clamping.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>With the help of a bigger piece of wood on top of the acrylic plank, I clamped it down and let it dry overnight.</figcaption>
