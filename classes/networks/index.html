                <h3 class="section-subheading">Tracerouting to a Phone on IPV6</h3>
                <p>Reading the prompt, I became intrigued by the idea of tracerouting to my phones IP (given my phone is connected to cellular data). I got my phone's public address from <a href="http://ip2location.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ip2location.com</a>, which interestingly only gave me an IPV6 address.</p>
                <p>I found the <code>traceroute6</code> command and gave it a try but immediately got:</p>
                <pre>
<code class="console">connect: No route to host</code>
                </pre>
                <p>Reading more on it, and seeing the same result when running <code>traceroute6 google.com</code>, I came to the conclusion that my ISP does not have IPV6 support on for my home network.</p>
                <p>So I tried instead to use my phones IPV4, and got up to 13 hops before getting into private hosts without response:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>The traceroute did a few hops around NYC before jumping to Boston and then not reporting back anymore.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Identifying Autonomous Systems</h3>
                <p>After this, I attempted to traceroute to some sites I frequent. Very quickly I realized that almost every single time I would get timeouts on hops. So I decided to instead focus on the AS numbers and trying to identify what Autonomous Systems I pass through often.</p>
                <p>I used <code>traceroute -a host | grep -o '\[AS[0-9]\+\]'</code> for the following sites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>google.com</li>
                    <li>nyu.edu</li>
                    <li>github.com</li>
                    <li>chase.com</li>
                    <li>instagram.com</li>
                    <li>amazon.com</li>
                    <li>nytimes.com</li>
                    <li>itsnicethat.com</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A lot of hops returned no answer. But with the ones that did I compiled this list:</p>
                <pre>
[AS7843]	38	Charter Communications Inc (Spectrum)
[AS12271]	27	Charter Communications Inc (Spectrum)
[AS15169]	9	Google LLC
[AS33182]	8	HostDime.com, Inc.
[AS3356]	3	Level 3 Parent, LLC
[AS32934]	3	Facebook
[AS6461]	1	Zayo Bandwidth
[AS5773]	1	BCN Telecom Inc
                </pre>
                <p>Its no surprise that spectrum is the main Autonomous System I pass through since they are my ISP. The rest of them are also not very unusual, but I would need to make a larger amount of traceroutes to get a better picture of my common networking routes.</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Cloudflare's AI Labyrinth</h3>
                <p>Last week in class I mentioned having read about cloudflare intentionally trapping AI scrapers into a loop of hops and redirects. I looked into it again, reading <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's blog post on the subject</a>.</p>
                <p>How I explained it was not entirely accurate. The way it is explained in the linked article says that bots are sent into AI generated web pages that have internal links to more AI generated pages, essentially making them crawl sites that are not a real part of the visited site. In doing so, they waste their resources and time. Cloudflare also uses this a specialized tool to identify aggressive AI crawlers, which are the ones that will go deeper into the labyrinth.</p>

                <h2 class="project-subtitle"><u>Week 01</u> Setting up a host, firewall and readings</h2>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Droplet and Server</h3>
                <p>After being put on an activation hold by Digital Ocean for a day, everything went smoothly. I configured the server with an ssh key but later realized that, since that key was for the <code>root</code> user, and I preferred not reusing it, I'd have to make a new key.</p>
                <p>So I followed <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server">digital ocean's ssh key guide</a> and created a new one, saving the passphrase to my keychain and setting up my <code>.ssh/config</code> file nicely:</p>
                <pre>
<code class="console">Host uplink
    HostName &lt;server public IP&gt;
    User &lt;username&gt;
    IdentityFile &lt;path to private key&gt;
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
</code>
                </pre>
                <p> so I only have to type:</p>
                <pre>
<code class="console">$ssh uplink</code>
                </pre>
                <p>To log into my server. This took longer than I had planned but felt very nice to have a clean setup.</p>
                <p>I then had to briefly stop working on the server and forgot to power it off. When I came back a couple of hours later I setup the firewall and in a few minutes It had already blocked 64 connections. I wonder what could have been happening in that time the server was running without a firewall.</p>
                <p>Currently running the server for a few days before I do the firewall analysis</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Firewall Log Analysis</h3>
                <p>After running the server for a couple of days, I passed the logs to an excel sheet for analysis. Replacing spaces with tabs didn't work well for me when passing it to excel, so I instead replaced them with commas and used excel's text-to-columns feature.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blocked Connections:</strong> 3849</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of Unique IPs:</strong> 2116</li>
                    <li><strong>Most attempts from one IP:</strong> 54 attempts</li>
                    <li><strong>Location of said IP:</strong> Ashburn, VA Amazon Data Services Northern Virginia</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since its been visiting my IP so much, I decided to visit theirs. Curiously, it served a directory list.</p>
                <p>I opened each file. Turns out that one file contains a bunch of entries with the format:</p>
                <pre>
Discovered open port 5900/tcp on X.X.X.X   
                </pre>
                <p>So it seems this is some sort of scanner, discovering IP addresses where port 5900 is open. I looked it up and <strong>this is the port used by VNC</strong>. I've used VNC before to connect to a raspberry pi, so I imagine all of these IP addresses are allowing connections to remote control of a graphical desktop interface. Looking up the IP in AbuseIPDB said it has 16% confidence that it is an abusive host.</p>
                <p>This made me worry a bit more about the short time my server was running without a firewall, so I looked it up and found you can check the authentication logs to see successful logins. I used <code>grep</code> to only see lines with successful logins and everything made sense with when I have logged in.</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on Deb Chachra's <em>How Infrastructure Shapes Us</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chachra's argument on how infrastructure, something 'invisible'/taken for granted, deeply shape our lives resonates strongly with a lot of Georges Perec's philosophy of the infraordinary. I especially enjoy his text <a href="https://summitsguide.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/approaches-to-what.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Approaches to What?</a>, an invitation to look closely at the overlooked.</li>
                    <li>Moving to NYC and away from the systems I'm accustomed to in Colombia has made it at times easy to identify the differences in infrastructure that shape our experience:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surge pricing on electricity: seasons mean energy usage varies across the year. So the required size of the grid is unclear, it is strained in the winter and underused in the summer.</li>
                        <li>Lack of water meters: water tends to be included in rent. Individual water usage is not tracked and not charged. In some cases there is little deterrence from irresponsible consumption and waste.</li>
                        <li>Same with hot water. Heating is done in the scope of the building. In Colombia, water heating is done through each apartment's water heater.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on <em>Why Google Went Offline Today and a Bit about How the Internet Works</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I had no idea about the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Autonomous Systems (AS) numbers. I knew how the internet was a network of networks but didn't have a very clear image of how these get connected.</li>
                    <li>Would love to know more about where in this whole process DNS fits in with regards to BGP.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading"> Notes on <em>We finally know what caused the global tech outage – and how much it cost</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's intriguing to see how software can also be infrastructure, and how certain software infrastructures operate at a global level while being maintained by a single company. I assume, mostly due to lack of alternative softwares in niche markets and user reluctance to upgrade/migrate.</li>
