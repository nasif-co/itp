                <p>This first week was a refresher on the basic knowledge of electronics, through the development of some short practical labs and technical texts.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/variable-supply.webp" alt="Variable power supply reads 6.8V, 0.02A. The leads are connected to a multimeter in voltage reading mode. It reads 9.0V.">
                        <figcaption>I measured the variable supply before connecting it to the arduino. Was a bit surprised that the measurement on the multimeter was so different from the supply.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/power-arduino.webp" alt="Arduino Nano IoT 33 on the edge of a breadboard. Connected with red and blue cables to a variable power supply that reads 6.8V.">
                        <figcaption>With the measured voltage, I connected the arduino through the VIN pin. Built-in LED flashed with the "blink" sketch, indicating it was running.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/measure-arduino.webp" alt="Arduino Nano IoT 33 on the edge of a breadboard. Hands use a multimeter to measure two points on the breadboard, connected to vcc and ground. It reads 4.43V">
                        <figcaption>The board's VCC was measured as 4.43V, a bit high considering it is supposed to be 3.3V. Since I had never worked with a variable supply before, they might be something I'm overlooking.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Apart from those labs, I also measured the output voltage from an LM7805 when supplied power from the variable supply. The reading was once again very strange, which corroborated my suspicions that I must be misunderstanding something about the variable supply. I decided to switch to a standard supply for the next lab.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <video loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/fade-out-led.webm" controls></video>
                        <figcaption>I wired my blue LED as the provided diagram but decided to add a 4700μF capacitor in parallel with the LED. I thought this would cause it to both fade in and out, but it only faded out. I realized then that the fade in would be more complicated in these analog circuits, without PWM.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>This fade out reminded me of Maywa Denki's machines, some of which have lights that power on instantly with the beats of his music, and then fade away. I decided then to make my switch music-related.</p>
                <p>The idea was to make a simple switch that turns on the light to the rhythm of your feet tapping, an action usually done semi-subconsciously when you connect with the music.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/switch-1.webp" alt="A copper plate with a wire on top of it, connected with a small strip of copper tape.">
                        <figcaption>The first layer of my soft switch sandwich.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/switch-2.webp" alt="The foam piece of a headphone set on top of the copper plate.">
                        <figcaption>I used the foam of a headphone set as the dielectric for my soft switch.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/switch-3.webp" alt="Copper plate with a wire connected with copper tape. All on top of the foam piece.">
                        <figcaption>Next I added another layer of copper.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/switch-4.webp" alt="Soft switch built with two copper plates and a headphone piece foam in between.">
                        <figcaption>A little gaffer tape to hold it together.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>After testing it out, I noticed it was very hard to create a connection when tapping, so I iterated:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/switch-iteration.webp" alt="Soft switch built with two copper plates and a headphone piece foam in between. It is opened up, showing a crumpled up piece of copper inside the middle hole of the foam piece.">
                        <figcaption>To fix that issue and make it easier to close the circuit, I added a crumpled piece of copper inside.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Then the final switch was ready:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <video loading="lazy" src="https://assets.nasif.co/foot-switch-led.webm" controls></video>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>It could definitely benefit from a debounce algorithm on the switch press detection, but I was satisfied with the result considering it was an analog circuit :).</p>
