                <h2 class="project-subtitle">Week 02</h2>
                <p>Our 2nd week assignment consisted in making a physical installation that mimics a particular sound of our choosing. We started with a trip to the hardware store, testing the sounds of some objects.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <video controls src="https://assets.nasif.co/initial-sound-idea.webm" alt="A finger brushing over a blue plastic dish sponge."></video>
                        <figcaption>We found this brushing sound, especially the clicking that occurs when the plastic strands get caught onto the skin and then let go, to be somewhat like a fireplace, with its crackling embers.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>We then attempted to design and build a structure to reproduce this sound on its own.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>We made some sketches and tested out a mount with a heavy-duty metal wire.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>This first iteration of the machine made us realize that the DC motor didn't have enough torque to brush against the sponge.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>For the second iteration, we changed the motor for another type of DC motor with a gearbox that increased its torque.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">

                        <figcaption>To take advantage of the torque, we needed to have a very good mount for the cork onto the motor. So we took some measurments with a calliper.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The second iteration of the machine.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>This new iteration worked much better! However, due to the friction between the gears, the motor also made a much louder noise that obscured the sound we wanted to make.</p>
                <p>Therefore we made a recording and <strong>used the 30 band equalizer to amplify the frequencies of the sponge and muffle the frequencies of the gearbox</strong>, in order to get closer to the sound we wanted.</p>

                <p>For the first week, our assignment consisted of recording a series of sounds that represented different concepts. Together with Jinnie Shim & Ray Wang, we went out on a scavenger hunt and recorded the following audios.</p>
