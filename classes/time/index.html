                <h2 class="project-subtitle"><u>Week 05</u> Watchface and Design</h2>
                <p>For this week's assignment, I immediately thought of the Otsuka Lotec N. 06:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="https://baseec-img-mng.akamaized.net/images/item/origin/362901e5dad0db018b4702405d87f9ba.jpg?imformat=generic" alt="Otsuka Lotec n6 wristwatch">
                        <figcaption>Japanese watch, machined by hand</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>The movement of the arms is what captivates me the most. The idea that the arm falls back to zero on the left (and having a "0" on the watch) is mesmerizing to me. It also gives off this visual of a spedometer, feels like your day is ramping up and then once the hour is over, goes back down to zero. Like revolutions when you shift gears.</p>
                <p>I decided to remake the watchface on illustrator.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="https://assets.nasif.co/n6.svg" width="900">
                        <figcaption>SVG illustration. Took much longer than I expected so I didn't get to do the screws and the japanese text.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="https://assets.nasif.co/n6-outlines.webp">
                        <figcaption>Outline view of the illustrator file, showcasing all the paths I created for the various gradients and textures.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>This was pretty fun to make. For the font, I recognized the style of the typeface on the watch being like the machined typefaces described in <a href="https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/" target="_blank">this article about Gorton</a>. I looked for a few, like <a href="https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routed Gothic</a> but ended up going for <a href="https://www.ffonts.net/Gorton-Digital-Light.font.download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gorton Digital</a>, as the light variant was the closest to the design on the watch.</p>

                <h2 class="project-subtitle"><u>Week 04</u> Software Clock</h2>
                <p>For my software clock, I kept thinking about the way timezones are defined by longitudes, which are
                    an interesting way to slice the Earth. I don't think we usually feel a particular connection with
                    other in our same longitude, atleast not those far north/south.</p>
                <p>Looking it up, in reality the timezones are way more complicated than that unfortunately. The sun is
                    not the main player in determining times. Politics and society play a big role:</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/World_Time_Zones_Map.svg/2880px-World_Time_Zones_Map.svg.png"
                            alt="Map of the world divided into timezones.">
                        <figcaption>This is the timezones map from wikipedia, showing how longitudes are only the
                            initial consideration, modified by national borders and desires to not split countries in
                            time.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I find this particularly interesting on a personal level because Bogotá, the city where I've lived a
                    good portion of my life, and New York City share longitudes.</p>
                <p>So I decided to make a clock that would make these linear connections explicit, by showing you your
                    microtimezone and the time on it: Normally, <strong>in UTC time, 1 hour is equivalent to 15º of
                        separation in longitude.</strong> Therefore, we are more or less (not in all cases) grouped into
                    15º chunks and assigned the same time for the whole slice.</p>
                <p>However, if 15º is 1 hour, this means that <strong>0.00416667º is 1 second. This logic splits the
                        earth in ~86,400 ultra accurate timezones.</strong> This is what my software clock does:
                    <strong>it shows you the time in your current microtimezone, detected through GPS</strong>.</p>

                <p>(The clock will not work well without permission to access GPS).

                <h2 class="project-subtitle"><u>Week 03</u> Hardware Clock</h2>
                <p>For this weeks assignment, I wanted to experiment with mechanical relays. To me, their ticking sound
                    and movement is very similar to the escapement mechanism that drives mechanical clocks.</p>
                <div class="image-slide">
                    <figure>
                        <video src="https://assets.nasif.co/relay-clock.webm" controls></video>
                        <figcaption>5 mechanical relays run by a microcontroller at different intervals.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>The clock I built has 5 sound "dials", each one activated on a different interval, but all multiples
                    of 200ms, as can be seen in the code:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-c++">
const int numPins = 5;
const int pins[numPins] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
int state[numPins] = {HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, HIGH};
unsigned long last[numPins] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0,};
int interval[numPins] = {200, 400, 600, 800, 1000};

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < numPins; i++) {
    pinMode(pins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < numPins; i++) {
    if (millis() - last[i] > interval[i]) {
      last[i] = millis();
      state[i] = state[i] == HIGH ? LOW : HIGH;
      digitalWrite(pins[i], state[i]);
    }
  }

}
                </code></pre>
                <p>However, as heard in the video, these relays fall out of sync. I imagined I would be able to hear
                    them ticking at the same time, just some of them would "chime in" less frequently than others.
                    Nonetheless, as time passes, they fall further and further out of sync.</p>
                <p>I imagine this is due to the speed of the armature not being fast enough to 'hit' right on the beat.
                    But I also wonder if my code is slowly compounding a distance between them through the
                    <code>last</code> value for each one, causing them to drift apart over time. This drifting apart is
                    to me a very beautiful phenomenon, especially because, for short moments, they come back in sync.

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Dendrochronology</h3>
                <p>Thinking about a natural pattern that had special meaning for me, I was brought back to a qualm I
                    usually have with woodworking. Despite how much I enjoy it, it feels like whatever I make has to be
                    grand enough to have warranted the tree's contribution. And even then, I feel only certain
                    masterpieces achieve that.</p>
                <p>This definitely has to do with the age of trees and the fact that they can easily outlive us. So I
                    decided to focus on the age of trees and the way they record their time through their rings. This, I
                    came to find out, is called <strong>dendrochronology</strong> and it is paired with
                    <strong>dendroclimatology</strong> as the rings not only keep track of years, but also provide hints
                    as to the climate of each year.</p>
                <p>Each ring consists of a paler lighter section (spring and early summer wood) and a darker denser
                    section (late summer and fall wood). Generally, a ring can be thought of as a year (although under
                    stress this is not always the case).</p>
                <p>I came across a great public dataset of dendrochronology named Urudendro, including images of yellow
                    pines from the north of Uruguay. I built a small code sketch that would simulate a timelapse of
                    their rings and allow us to see how they grew and the time they kept. The original sketch has the
                    whole 64 trees, but this video excerpt shows just three:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Our experience of life and time was so intertwined with the celestial bodies, that it seems
                        unbelievable how we have completely abstracted time from them.</li>
                    <li>It feels to me that mechanical clocks act like a microcosm of the orbits/rotations of celestial
                        bodies. They're like having a realtime link to the sky on our wrists.</li>
                    <li>The religious link with timekeeping makes sense. In spanish the word for 'Sky' and 'Heaven' is
                        one and the same: 'Cielo'. Therefore, it is clear how our spirituality has been linked with the
                        cosmos and timekeeping can be, in a way, keeping track of the heavens.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on Moore's Wall and Singularity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Last year I attended a lecture by Tandon Dean Juan de Pablo on his research in developing
                        methods for the reliable construction of integrated circuits with microscopic circuits inside.
                        It was fascinating to see and also daunting to consider how humanity has pushed the limits of
                        their senses to advance technology.</li>
                    <li>I used to have the feeling that Moore's law was plateauing. That we were reaching some
                        diminishing returns. However, with the prevalence of machine learning, it feels the speed at
                        which we move has multiplied. Sometimes feels too fast for our senses, in the same way as the
                        previous point.</li>
                    <li>The idea of the singularity as described in most of the chapter relies too heavily on science
                        fiction. The idea of an unforeseen property of the internet "suddenly awakening" makes it sound
                        as if the internet was a mythological beast. This sort of rhetoric just feels fatalistic.</li>
                    <li>Some aspects however are interesting, like the idea of loosing the ability of prediction because
                        of speed. How prediction is rooted on observation and analysis of repetitions, and how this
                        practice might become impossible if less iterations happen on the way to the future.
                        Unknowability then feels like a real possibility.</li>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Sundial</h3>
                <p>After researching sundials, I realized their geometry is pretty tightly connected to the latitude in
                    which they are placed, as well as the direction of true north. This makes sundials too site-specific
                    and require some calculation to set up properly, which I don't really enjoy.</p>
                <p>So I decided to make a sundial that is modular, in the sense that the user can add their own hourly
                    markings based on the shadows they see. This way, there's no need to point north and the angle of
                    the gnomon is not a big issue.</p>

                        our individual lifespans.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like a good answer, but by no means a trend. The most recent slowness I remember
                        was the 2020 pandemic, forcing a pause, a slow down. But the ramp up after has been vicious. It
                        feels like we can only slow down and reconsider at the verge of the collective abyss.</li>
                    <li>The same situation occurred with rebuilding the ozone, where the Montréal Protocol was set at
                        the cusp of irreversible crisis.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like an unrealistic expectation, history tends to show that humanity has
                        extremely short foresight, but at the same time, unimaginable effectiveness in the face of
                        imminent danger.</li>

                    <li>The use of water and weights to measure time is fascinating, especially the clepsydra and the
                        way a float was used very elegantly in conjunction to a rack and pinion connected to a dial.
                    </li>
                    <li>The etymology of the minute and second.</li>
                    <li>I have heard about so called 'Brothel Candles' or <strong>'Pocket Candles'</strong>, which
                        burned for 7 minutes more or less precisely. Allegedly used by sex workers but in general used
                        as timers.</li>
                    <li>I've also read about <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Knocker-Uppers</a></strong>, who were employed to wake people
                        up by tapping on their windows with a long stick or a pea shooter.</li>
                    <li>The idea that non-military people cared little about time at night is not absolute, especially
                        in Elizabethan time, when "<em>night-time slumber was divided into ‘first’ and ‘second’ sleeps,
                            separated by a time when people would wake up and take part in activities such as
                            socializing, reading, or praying.</em>" (<a
