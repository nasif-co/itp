                <h3 class="section-subheading">Sundial</h3>
                <p>After researching sundials, I realized their geometry is pretty tightly connected to the latitude in which they are placed, as well as the direction of true north. This makes sundials too site-specific and require some calculation to set up properly, which I don't really enjoy.</p>
                <p>So I decided to make a sundial that is modular, in the sense that the user can add their own hourly markings based on the shadows they see. This way, there's no need to point north and the angle of the gnomon is not a big issue.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is daunting to think of our responsibility to the future people. Younger generations can often feel that our elders and ancestors did not have that responsibility with us, and it can feel overwhelming to try to correct a course that has been ongoing for longer than multiple of our individual lifespans.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like a good answer, but by no means a trend. The most recent slowness I remember was the 2020 pandemic, forcing a pause, a slow down. But the ramp up after has been vicious. It feels like we can only slow down and reconsider at the verge of the collective abyss.</li>
                    <li>The same situation occurred with rebuilding the ozone, where the Montréal Protocol was set at the cusp of irreversible crisis.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like an unrealistic expectation, history tends to show that humanity has extremely short foresight, but at the same time, unimaginable effectiveness in the face of imminent danger.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on <em>The Clock We Live On: Following the Sun</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of water and weights to measure time is fascinating, especially the clepsydra and the way a float was used very elegantly in conjunction to a rack and pinion connected to a dial.</li>
                    <li>The etymology of the minute and second.</li>
                    <li>I have heard about so called 'Brothel Candles' or <strong>'Pocket Candles'</strong>, which burned for 7 minutes more or less precisely. Allegedly used by sex workers but in general used as timers.</li>
                    <li>I've also read about <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knocker-Uppers</a></strong>, who were employed to wake people up by tapping on their windows with a long stick or a pea shooter.</li>
                    <li>The idea that non-military people cared little about time at night is not absolute, especially in Elizabethan time, when "<em>night-time slumber was divided into ‘first’ and ‘second’ sleeps, separated by a time when people would wake up and take part in activities such as socializing, reading, or praying.</em>" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404514/#:~:text=For%20Elizabethans%2C%20night%2Dtime%20slumber,socializing%2C%20reading%2C%20or%20praying." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</li>
