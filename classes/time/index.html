                <h3 class="section-subheading">Dendrochronology</h3>
                <p>Thinking about a natural pattern that had special meaning for me, I was brought back to a qualm I usually have with woodworking. Despite how much I enjoy it, it feels like whatever I make has to be grand enough to have warranted the tree's contribution. And even then, I feel only certain masterpieces achieve that.</p>
                <p>This definitely has to do with the age of trees and the fact that they can easily outlive us. So I decided to focus on the age of trees and the way they record their time through their rings. This, I came to find out, is called <strong>dendrochronology</strong> and it is paired with <strong>dendroclimatology</strong> as the rings not only keep track of years, but also provide hints as to the climate of each year.</p>
                <p>Each ring consists of a paler lighter section (spring and early summer wood) and a darker denser section (late summer and fall wood). Generally, a ring can be thought of as a year (although under stress this is not always the case).</p>
                <p>I came across a great public dataset of dendrochronology named Urudendro, including images of yellow pines from the north of Uruguay. I built a small code sketch that would simulate a timelapse of their rings and allow us to see how they grew and the time they kept. The original sketch has the whole 64 trees, but this video excerpt shows just three:</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on The Inconstant Moon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our experience of life and time was so intertwined with the celestial bodies, that it seems unbelievable how we have completely abstracted time from them.</li>
                    <li>It feels to me that mechanical clocks act like a microcosm of the orbits/rotations of celestial bodies. They're like having a realtime link to the sky on our wrists.</li>
                    <li>The religious link with timekeeping makes sense. In spanish the word for 'Sky' and 'Heaven' is one and the same: 'Cielo'. Therefore, it is clear how our spirituality has been linked with the cosmos and timekeeping can be, in a way, keeping track of the heavens.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on Moore's Wall and Singularity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Last year I attended a lecture by Tandon Dean Juan de Pablo on his research in developing methods for the reliable construction of integrated circuits with microscopic circuits inside. It was fascinating to see and also daunting to consider how humanity has pushed the limits of their senses to advance technology.</li>
                    <li>I used to have the feeling that Moore's law was plateauing. That we were reaching some diminishing returns. However, with the prevalence of machine learning, it feels the speed at which we move has multiplied. Sometimes feels too fast for our senses, in the same way as the previous point.</li>
                    <li>The idea of the singularity as described in most of the chapter relies too heavily on science fiction. The idea of an unforeseen property of the internet "suddenly awakening" makes it sound as if the internet was a mythological beast. This sort of rhetoric just feels fatalistic.</li>
                    <li>Some aspects however are interesting, like the idea of loosing the ability of prediction because of speed. How prediction is rooted on observation and analysis of repetitions, and how this practice might become impossible if less iterations happen on the way to the future. Unknowability then feels like a real possibility.</li>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Sundial</h3>
                <p>After researching sundials, I realized their geometry is pretty tightly connected to the latitude in which they are placed, as well as the direction of true north. This makes sundials too site-specific and require some calculation to set up properly, which I don't really enjoy.</p>
                <p>So I decided to make a sundial that is modular, in the sense that the user can add their own hourly markings based on the shadows they see. This way, there's no need to point north and the angle of the gnomon is not a big issue.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is daunting to think of our responsibility to the future people. Younger generations can often feel that our elders and ancestors did not have that responsibility with us, and it can feel overwhelming to try to correct a course that has been ongoing for longer than multiple of our individual lifespans.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like a good answer, but by no means a trend. The most recent slowness I remember was the 2020 pandemic, forcing a pause, a slow down. But the ramp up after has been vicious. It feels like we can only slow down and reconsider at the verge of the collective abyss.</li>
                    <li>The same situation occurred with rebuilding the ozone, where the Montréal Protocol was set at the cusp of irreversible crisis.</li>
                    <li>Slowness feels like an unrealistic expectation, history tends to show that humanity has extremely short foresight, but at the same time, unimaginable effectiveness in the face of imminent danger.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Notes on <em>The Clock We Live On: Following the Sun</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of water and weights to measure time is fascinating, especially the clepsydra and the way a float was used very elegantly in conjunction to a rack and pinion connected to a dial.</li>
                    <li>The etymology of the minute and second.</li>
                    <li>I have heard about so called 'Brothel Candles' or <strong>'Pocket Candles'</strong>, which burned for 7 minutes more or less precisely. Allegedly used by sex workers but in general used as timers.</li>
                    <li>I've also read about <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knocker-Uppers</a></strong>, who were employed to wake people up by tapping on their windows with a long stick or a pea shooter.</li>
                    <li>The idea that non-military people cared little about time at night is not absolute, especially in Elizabethan time, when "<em>night-time slumber was divided into ‘first’ and ‘second’ sleeps, separated by a time when people would wake up and take part in activities such as socializing, reading, or praying.</em>" (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404514/#:~:text=For%20Elizabethans%2C%20night%2Dtime%20slumber,socializing%2C%20reading%2C%20or%20praying." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</li>
